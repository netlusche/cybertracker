*   **MVC Backend Revolution**: Transitioned to a centralized Front Controller, Domain Controllers, and Repository patterns for database interactions without external frameworks.

# CyberTasker v1.9 (Security Hardening & Multi-Theme)
*Release Date: 2026-02-20*

*   **OWASP Security Baseline**: Zero-config auto-locks prevent unauthorized installer access. Implemented enterprise CSRF middleware, strict CORS, and session fixation regenerations. Database errors are now sterilized before hitting the client.

*   **Theme Engine**: Introduced the robust Multi-Theme architecture supporting persistent visual identities (Cyberpunk vs. LCARS), strictly isolating CSS semantic variables to prevent "theme bleeding".

*   **Multilingual Link**: Fully localized UI payloads deployed for DE, EN, NL, ES, FR, and IT.
